# Full Stack Development Test - Week Two

This assessment tests your understanding of classes, testing, HOFs and list-type data structures.

## Guidelines

- The resources you may use online are:
  - [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
  - [Chai docs](https://www.chaijs.com/api/)
- Make sure you give yourself a grade before turning it in!

## Tips

- Use your whiteboard to draw the problem.
- Write pseudocode before writing code.

## Steps to run the test

```bash
yarn
yarn test
```

## Self-Assessment

Give yourself a grade for each question. Explain why you gave yourself that grade.

| Grade | Explanation                                                        |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   4   | I understood this completely and did not struggle answering it.    |
|   3   | I think I did well, but I didn't totally understand why it worked. |
|   2   | I think I was close, but I didn't get the answer.                  |
|   1   | I am struggling with this question.                                |
|   0   | I did not attempt this question (explain why)                      |

### 1. Create and extend classes

- Grade: 2
- Explanation: I think I understood the questions well, but the only problem was the yarn tests.
- Unfortunately, I spent a lot of time trying to get the yarn tests to work properly, the majority of my time was dedicated to this.
- However, I do think I understood what was asked of me and believe that what I wrote was close.

### 2. Create tests for classes

- Grade: 2
- Explanation: Same explanation as #1

### 3. Use HOFs from the Array prototype

- Grade: 2
- Explanation: I remember we had a similar basketball activitiy (filtering ages and teams) and I thought this activity was similar.
- Again, I didn't have enough time to go back and see why my yarn tests weren't working properly. However, I thought this activity was quite similar
- to previous ones we've done together as a class.

### 4. Create the reverse linked list method

- Grade: 2
- Explanation: I LOVED the explaination and step-by-step instructions on how to do this. This really helped me map out what I needed to do.

// Unfortunately, I've had to give myself a 2 on everything since I did not get the passing tests in yarn.
// I will be looking over and studying the chai assertion library to better familiarize myself.
// However, I do feel that I understood the questions and knew how to answer them and if I had more time, I could find out why I wasn't getting the tests back.
